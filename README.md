This is my first attempt at making a standard website using HTML.
During this attempt, my knowledge regarding basic HTML will be demonstrated.
I'm fortunate enough to have learned a bit of HTML in high school and building this website wasn't such a daunting task. 
I didn't really struggle with anything. I attempted to keep the code clean and tidy.
To see what the lines of code do within the browser is fascinating.
I really enjoyed this assignment.
